> The goal of this project was to monitor Weddel seal activity during the Scott Base rebuild at Antartica (starting 2022/2023 summer) to ensure that they are minimally disrupted by building activity. Over the 2021/2022 summer, two 180Mp cameras were successfully installed at Pram Point and Turtle Rock, capturing continuous time-lapse image data of seals from November to February. With support from our deep learning team, this data was analysed for seal count/positioning to ensure this tech is fit-for-purpose for monitoring impact on seals of the Scott Base rebuild that starts late 2022.

## Method

This solution applies a RetinaNet CNN to detect the small and dense seals. The object detector can detect individual seals and a pairing of seals. Additionally, a second CNN was developed to detect low-visability inducing Antractic Snowstorms. These snowstorms greatly affect the validity of the seal detection CNN as they objstuct the view of the seals. Detection of Snowstorms allows for detection of false low-counts.

## Project Objectives

- [x] Recieve and store large RAW images from two time lapse cameras from Nov 2021 — Feb 2022

- [x] Design & Train an accurate CNN model to detect Weddel Seals from afar

- [x] Use the trained model to generate Seal counts for each image

- [x] Plot Seal counts over the season (including the timestamp)

- [x] Condense images into a short (~5 Minutes) Timelapse

- [x] Combine timelapse and Seal detections to create a Heatmap Timelapse showing Movement

- [x] Provide a report including a description of the seal population, and summary assessment based on the statistics obtained through analysis. This report is to include tables, maps, and images as appropriate to support the Scott Base Redevelopment environmental monitoring.

- [x] Provide an advice note containing recommendations for the next summer season based on the previous summer season results (include cost, power, logistics/support) – with the additional goals of:

  - Real-time alert for seal disturbance by construction noise
  - Accurate 3D seal location
  - Identification of individual seals using available biometric data

## Future Scope

- Mathematically model the seal counts as a function of time. (Usefull for detecting disturbance of colony)

- Statistical analysis on the raw data, including an identification and analysis of possible disturbance events.

## Setup Steps

This project has been deleveloped with a Conda environment for ease of reproduction. If you do not have conda installed, run `./install_conda.sh`.

To install the conda environment with all required dependencies run `conda env create -f environment.yaml python=3.8`.

To activate the environment run `conda activate seal_env`.

## Training Seal model

The main script (used for training) can be run with `python -m Models.Seals.main`. Input parameters, their descriptions and defaults can be viewed by adding the `-h` or `--help`.

Example below:

```bash
python -m Models.Seals.main --first 2 --input "coco --path annotations.json --image_root /img_location --split_ratio 70/15/15" --log_dir Models/Seals/log --image_size 512 --validation_pause 16 --run_name Seals
```

## Analysing a dataset

```bash
python -m scripts.crop_and_convert.py --input_dir /path/to/input_dir --output_dir /path/to/output_dir --crop_box left upper right lower
python -m scripts.locate_seals.py --model_path "path/to/your/model.pth" --mask_path "path/to/your/mask.jpg" --input_dir "path/to/your/images" --output_dir "path/to/your/output" --output_name "output_filename.csv"
python -m scripts.filter_seal_locations.py --input_csv "path/to/your/input.csv" --output_csv "path/to/your/output.csv"
python -m scripts.counts_from_locations.py --input_csv "path/to/your/input.csv" --output_csv "path/to/your/output.csv"
python -m scripts.heatmap.create_timelapse.py
python -m scripts.heatmap.create_heatmap.py
```

## Large Project Artifacts
